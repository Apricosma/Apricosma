## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

You can call me Apricot, Cosma, or *Apricosma!* 

I'm a full-stack developer currently studying software engineering at [MITT](https://mitt.ca/)

My interests include, but aren't limited to:
- ðŸ‘“ Virtual Reality
- ðŸ¤– Artifical Intelligence
- ðŸ§  Machine Learning
- ðŸŽ¨ Design 

I'm a long way from most of these right now, but I hope to get there in the future with hard work and passion

Please find my current projects listed below
